Inconsistant warnings for field errors, some fields display a red 'X' inside the field, others turn the labels and borders red and some just turn the borders red (bug on DOB div, class is not updated to include "has-error").
	cannot sweep page for errors, need a custom check for each field
No validation on Other Gender(free-text), would expect this field to be required when visible.
No validation on missing mobile number or email only bad format.
Email will not accept top level domains eg bob@com
No support for international phone numbers (or uk numbers in international format).
Unlike other selects, Country of birth cannot be empty, no way to validate that the user forgot to populate it.
Invalid dates do not appear to get validated (eg 31/02/2020).
		Neither do future dates.
Form uses DOB not age, need to provide some way to convert between them. Tests will need to be able to specify a date or age.
Should we be able to specify an age that is not a whole number? 
	If there are any conditions that are triggered by age then we will need a way to test boundries down to the day!
		if we use age in years 1 day would be 0.00274 years which would make the tests difficult to read.
		if we use age in days 18 years old would be 6574.5 which would also be difficult to read.
		Age in years and days would get confused by leap years .
		age in years,+/-days.
Password validation message only displayed if all other validations passed.
